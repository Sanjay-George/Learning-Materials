# Learning-Materials
This repo will contain all learning materials that I've used for C#, .NET core / framework, Javascript and its Frameworks, MySQL, etc..


## .NET Core
1. [Dependency Injection using IServiceProvider](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection-usage) : Also illustrates **singleton**, **transient** and **scoped** objects.
2. [Registering multiple implementations of interface in .NET core](https://dejanstojanovic.net/aspnet/2018/december/registering-multiple-implementations-of-the-same-interface-in-aspnet-core/): Update how this is handled in .NET framework?
